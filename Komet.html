        <p>During the summer of 2023, I worked as an Android development intern at SkyIT, a tech company dedicated to transforming the aviation fleet industry with reliable and innovative services. As part of my role, I contributed to the development of an Android app called "Komet," which aimed to support aviation school operators. Komet offers a comprehensive fleet asset monitoring software and integrated aviation fleet management platform, customized to meet their specific requirements. By utilizing data-driven insights and real-time monitoring, Komet empowers fleet operators to optimize operations, cut costs, and achieve better performance.</p>

        <p>During my internship, I had a broader role than just developing the Android app. Komet, which was developed using Kotlin, involved machine learning for accurately classifying audio data. I actively contributed to the ML prediction part, refining the algorithm and improving the model's performance. This experience enhanced my understanding of integrating machine learning into practical applications and emphasized the significance of teamwork and collaboration across different disciplines in complex projects like Komet.</p>
