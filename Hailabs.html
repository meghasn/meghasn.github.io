        <p>Hailabs is an accredited startup, recognized by Startup India, driven by a vision to become the most trusted and beloved Artificial Intelligence teaching company globally. This innovative venture focuses on facilitating children's learning of data science through interactive activities and projects. As a co-founder and ML-AI Researcher at Hailabs, I had the privilege of leading the development of a cutting-edge web application designed to empower young learners with essential data literacy skills and foster a passion for AI. Through a comprehensive curriculum comprising 27 modules and 12 hands-on projects, Hailabs aims to equip students in grades 4 through 9 with the necessary knowledge and understanding to thrive in an increasingly data-driven world.</p>

        <p>During my tenure at Hailabs, I actively participated in brainstorming sessions to develop the platform's innovative ideas. I began by presenting ideas in competitions and went on to curate curriculum content and conduct live sessions with students and teachers. Additionally, I contributed to discussions on product architecture, assisted in designing the CMS, and conducted QA testing. Planning for the next sprint and researching AI algorithms for optimal platform implementation were also integral parts of my role, as I continuously strived to empower young learners through data literacy and AI education.</p>
