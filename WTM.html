        <p>From the early days of my undergraduate studies, I found a sense of belonging within the Women Techmakers (WTM) community, a global initiative by Google aimed at empowering women in the technology field. As a dedicated member of WTM, I witnessed the incredible impact it had on women pursuing careers in tech, fostering an environment of support and encouragement. In 2020, I had the honor of taking on the role of a Google WTM Ambassador, a transformative experience that opened doors to numerous opportunities for growth and development. Attending monthly meetups and regional events, I connected with energetic and ambitious women, all working towards a common goal of creating a more inclusive and diverse tech industry.</p>

        <p>As a WTM Ambassador, one of the most significant advantages has been the chance to network with Google professionals and successful individuals from both technical and non-technical backgrounds. These connections offered unique insights into the industry and exposed me to diverse career paths, fueling my passion for excellence in my own journey. Engaging with professionals who are deeply passionate about their work has been a motivating experience, inspiring me to continuously strive for personal and professional growth.</p>

        <p>A core aspect of being a WTM Ambassador is the opportunity to contribute actively to the promotion of Google products and technologies. Through hosting workshops and writing blogs on cutting-edge technology, I have been able to share my knowledge and expertise with fellow community members, refining my communication and leadership skills in the process. Moreover, the sense of community and support within WTM has been unparalleled. The mentorship available within the network has been instrumental in my growth, empowering me to uplift other women in tech and encouraging them to pursue their dreams with confidence. Together, as Google WTM Ambassadors, we aim to break down barriers and pave the way for a more diverse and inclusive tech industry. I am deeply grateful for the skills I have gained, the connections I have made, and the unwavering support of the Women Techmakers community on my journey of empowerment and growth.</p>
