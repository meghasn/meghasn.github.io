        <p>As the event organizer of Lean In Tech at CUSAT (Cochin University of Science and Technology), I have had the incredible opportunity to create a supportive and empowering community for students looking to pursue careers in the tech industry. Inspired by the Lean In principles, we formed a tight-knit Circle of both women and men who shared the common goal of fostering ambition and professional growth.</p>

        <p>Throughout our journey, we held multiple engaging and informative sessions that catered to the diverse needs of our members. Our monthly meetings became a platform for participants to support one another, share experiences, and learn new skills. We organized group study sessions, enabling students to collaborate and excel in their academic pursuits. Additionally, we hosted webinars featuring industry professionals who offered valuable insights into the tech world, shedding light on career paths, industry trends, and challenges. One of the most rewarding aspects of leading Lean In Tech at CUSAT was witnessing the growth and development of our members. As the Circle leader, I saw firsthand how the community became a source of deep connections and friendships. Many participants found new allies and mentors within the Circle, and this support system contributed to their increased self-confidence and willingness to embrace challenges.</p>

        <p>As the organizer, I also gained valuable skills and experiences. The responsibilities of coordinating events, managing communication, and leading discussions honed my leadership abilities and taught me how to navigate group dynamics effectively. I learned the importance of empathy, active listening, and inclusivity, ensuring that every member felt valued and heard in our community. Overall, leading Lean In Tech at CUSAT has been an incredibly fulfilling experience for me personally. Witnessing the positive impact on our members' lives, as they took on new challenges and gained confidence, has been immensely rewarding. The skills I acquired and the connections I made as the event organizer will undoubtedly continue to influence my personal and professional growth long into the future.</p>
