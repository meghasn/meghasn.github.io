        <p>Mayo Clinic is a renowned medical research institution, known for its commitment to innovative healthcare advancements. As a collaborative initiative between Arizona State University (ASU) and Mayo Clinic, it serves as a hub for cutting-edge research in various fields, including Computer Vision. The institution's dedication to pioneering medical technologies has attracted talented researchers and students, driving groundbreaking projects that have a significant impact on the healthcare industry.</p>

        <p>During my tenure as a research intern at Mayo Clinic, I had the privilege of working under the guidance of Professor Imon Banerjee on a fascinating Computer Vision project. The project focused on wound sensing and treatment research, where we collaborated with NCSU to optimize sensors. By leveraging Python and OpenCV, I actively contributed to enhancing sensor image quality and accuracy through image registration, computer graphics techniques, and image processing. Our efforts resulted in a remarkable 75% improvement in image quality and accuracy, further advancing the field of Computer Vision and its potential applications in healthcare.</p>
