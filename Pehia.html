        <p>Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have had the privilege of being a part of Pehia, a non-profit organization that is dedicated to empowering women and other underrepresented communities in the technical field. Pehia envisions a world where the gender gap in technology is bridged, creating an inclusive environment for students and professionals alike. Being one of the most prestigious organizations of its kind in Kerala, India, Pehia Foundation has been instrumental in uplifting countless bright minds through enlightening workshops, peer learning groups, and online coding competitions. The foundation also provides invaluable mentorship for participants at all levels, encouraging them to collaborate in hackathons to drive innovative solutions for real-world problems. Moreover, Pehia Foundation opens doors to various opportunities like internships, jobs, and scholarships, while providing a platform to showcase one's tech skills.</p>

        <p>From my early days as an undergraduate student, I actively engaged with Pehia Foundation and became deeply involved in the community. As I grew along with Pehia, I took on the role of an organizer for their events, including summits and webinars. This experience not only strengthened my organizational and leadership skills but also allowed me to interact with esteemed speakers from the industry. I learned to write and send professional emails, schedule meetings without conflicts, and manage event logistics seamlessly. Being a part of these events and workshops nurtured my passion for technology and empowered me to break through barriers. The support and encouragement from the community were unparalleled, and I felt a sense of belonging and purpose that fueled my personal growth.</p>

Through my active involvement and dedication, I was able to contribute back to the community that had given me so much. My acquired skills and experiences not only transformed me into a more confident and capable individual but also enabled me to assist others within the community effectively. As an advocate for diversity and inclusivity in technology, I am determined to continue making a positive impact, encouraging more individuals from underrepresented backgrounds to pursue careers in technology. Pehia Foundation has truly been a stepping stone in my journey, propelling me towards success while inspiring me to uplift others along the way.
